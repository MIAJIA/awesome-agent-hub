  "purpose": "To develop an AI that can play the Chinese card game DouDizhu at a high skill level using self-play reinforcement learning techniques.",
  "principle": "Employs deep reinforcement learning with a focus on self-play to iteratively improve the AI's performance in the game of DouDizhu.",
  "reusability": "Can be used as a foundation for developing AI agents for other card games or similar turn-based strategy games. The codebase is modular, allowing for customization and adaptation.",
  "limitations": "Primarily focused on DouDizhu, may require significant adaptation for other games; computationally intensive training process.",
