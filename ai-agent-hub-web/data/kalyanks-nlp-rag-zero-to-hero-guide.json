  "purpose": "To educate and guide users through the process of understanding and implementing Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques.",
  "principle": "The guide leverages RAG methodology, combining retrieval of relevant information with generative AI models to enhance response accuracy and relevance.",
  "reusability": "The guide is structured as a series of Jupyter Notebooks, allowing users to interactively engage with the content, modify examples, and apply concepts to their own projects.",
  "limitations": "Being a guide, it requires users to have a basic understanding of AI and programming. It does not provide a ready-to-deploy solution but rather educational content.",
