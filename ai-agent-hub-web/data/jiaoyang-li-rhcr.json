  "purpose": "Solve Multi-Agent Path Finding problems efficiently over the long term",
  "principle": "Utilizes heuristic search algorithms to optimize pathfinding for multiple agents over time",
  "reusability": "The solver can be integrated into larger systems requiring multi-agent coordination, with customizable parameters for different scenarios",
  "limitations": "Primarily focused on pathfinding; may not handle dynamic changes in agent goals or environments without re-computation",
