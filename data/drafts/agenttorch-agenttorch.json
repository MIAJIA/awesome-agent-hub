  "category": "experimental",
  "status": "alpha",
  "purpose": "To provide a framework for developing and simulating large-scale agent-based models that facilitate scientific research and analysis.",
  "principle": "Built on the principles of agent-based modeling, AgentTorch enables the creation of complex simulations where individual agents interact within a defined environment, allowing for emergent behaviors and insights.",
  "reusability": "AgentTorch is designed to be modular and extensible, allowing users to reuse components and integrate their own models easily.",
  "limitations": "As an alpha project, AgentTorch may have stability issues, limited documentation, and incomplete features that could affect its usability in production environments.",
