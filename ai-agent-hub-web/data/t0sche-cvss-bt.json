  "principle": "Utilizes Python to process and enhance CVSS data with additional metrics, potentially leveraging data from the National Vulnerability Database (NVD).",
  "reusability": "Can be integrated into security assessment workflows to provide more nuanced vulnerability scores; potential for API-based integration.",
  "limitations": "Dependent on the accuracy and completeness of underlying CVSS and NVD data; may not cover all possible threat scenarios.",
