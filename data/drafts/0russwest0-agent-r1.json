  "category": "experimental",
  "status": "alpha",
  "purpose": "To train large language model (LLM) agents using end-to-end reinforcement learning techniques, enabling them to perform complex tasks autonomously.",
  "principle": "The agent is designed to learn from interactions with its environment, optimizing its performance through reinforcement signals to improve decision-making capabilities over time.",
  "reusability": "The framework is modular and designed for easy integration with various machine learning workflows, allowing developers to adapt and extend its functionalities for different applications.",
  "limitations": "The current implementation is in alpha stage, which may lead to instability and limited functionality. Performance may vary based on the complexity of tasks and the quality of training data.",
